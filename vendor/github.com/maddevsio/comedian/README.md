## How can comedian help you to spend less time on the stand up meetings

First things first you need to start do daily meetings in slack. Create a channel for it. Then add this bot and ask your team to write messages with this template

1. What I did yesterday(with tasks description)
2. What I'm going to do today
3. What problems I've faced.

This messages should be written with @botusername mention. The comedian will store it for you and give a convinient reports for you about stand ups.
